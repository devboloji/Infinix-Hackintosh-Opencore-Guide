<hr>

### if anyone contributed for this project, I will update EFI for every release. A small cotribution will also be appreciated. If anyone are ready to contribute their EFI here will be appriciated too. Because this repository is growed as a main branch for our Infinix INBOOKS Hackintosh. So anyone can work in this repository about our all INFINIX INBOOKS but give credits. EOL due to i don't have a infinix laptop(broken).

 <summary><strong>What's not working ‚ö†Ô∏è</strong></summary>
 </br>
 
* :heavy_exclamation_mark: Hdmi slot. To get work, buy a USB Dock.(Try Type-c and usb Type A docks for our infinix) IF the usb Type-C dock works for display out, Inform me.
* :heavy_exclamation_mark: Didn't Mapped Keyboard keys. But it's not mandatory. I like the default keyboard mapping.
* :heavy_exclamation_mark: Audio is dead in x2 or x1 slim due to those devices have intel bluetooth sound cards. But using via headphones or bluetooth or any external audio dongle will work for x2 and x1 slim. Audio is 100% working for x1 and x1 pro.
* :heavy_exclamation_mark: Don't expect too much battery in this Hackintosh like windows. You get atleast 6-hours battery-backup more.

- The performance is better than windows and linux.(don't check benchmarks with geekbeench. You will see low scores than windows. But in performance, This macOS has great performance than windows, linux. I have tested in different sinarios, You can also test it and let us know about it.

- You definitely get more performance sure than windows without plugin the charge in this MacOS(Hacintosh)... I have tested blender in Both OSes.Blender worked very very smooth than windows(Tested my personal project has "realtime sky Nishita" which puts high work on device with blender 3.2.1.  So you can expect more performance it in My efi. Here, the performace is because of "Metal-Optimisation", but not optimised in "OpenCL" in windows, And we don't need openCL in macos according to me.. Don't except higher performace in gaming like windows & linux in macos


<img align="top" src="images/infinix x1 i3 benchmarks.jpeg" alt="infinx inbook x1 i3 laptop benchmarksimage" width="300">

- **I have also tested the python program benchmark test  (Just used terminal not IDE) : Results:** 

      In windows :
      
        - The program finished compiling on time (on balanced mode)- 4min 36sec.

        - The script finished compiling on time (on performance mode)- 4min 26sec.

      On macOS(hacintosh)without plugging in charge :
         
        - The program finished compiling on time - 4min 16sec.
     
      On Ubuntu 22.04 LTS(original) :
      
        - The program finished compiling on time (on Performance mode)- 4min 39sec.

   Used python 3.9 and This [benchmark script](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/program/mandelbrot-python3-7.html) compiled the program x16000 times once.
   
![WindowsVirtualboxBench](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87069967/205454534-a03595b8-6aa0-4f0f-8494-1504440f5eca.png)

And also I have tested Windows10 virtualbox with assigning 1core, 4gb ram 50gb storage in macOS monterey. These are the benchmarks.

**This is a simple and quick summary of the online install USB creation.**

### macOS Bigsur Installer with Windows And Mac Users:
<details>
 <summary><strong>Process1.MacOS BigSur Online Installer from Windows, linux and macOS:</strong></summary>
 
  -  **`For Windows users`**
 
     	 1. Download [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) to format the sdcard to fat32.
     	 2. Select the desired flash drive or Sdcard you would like to put the installer on under the device option
     	 3. Open rufus and Select `non-bootable` as the `boot selection` (REQUIRED)
     	 4. Select `FAT-32` or `Large FAT-32` as the partition scheme. Hit start(by doing this the sdcard formats so you will lose the all the data in sdcard).
     	 5. If in windows,Open up the usb partition in file explorer and delete all the files created by rufus manually.

  -  **`For mac users`**

         1. Launch `Disk Utility`
         2. `Select View` > `Show all devices` at the top left
         3. Select your flash drive (root usb device)and format it as `MS-DOS (FAT)` or `FAT-32`.
         4. change `guid patition table`-> `Master Boot Record Partiton`.
         5. hit start(by doing this the sdcard formats so you will lose the all the data in sdcard).
       
  -  **`For Linux users`**
  
  		    1. Install `gparted` and format the usb to `Fat32` and `MBR` OR `MASTER BOOT RECORD PARTITION.
  	    	2. DONE.
  		
6. Then ......................
7. Now, Install Python from Microsoft store or Download manually for MAC,linux and Windows users here -> [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure you select add python x.x to path to environmet variables for windows users.)
8. Download and extract the [OpenCore Package](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) (Release version is fine).
9. Select the "macrecovery" folder in the "opencorepkg" folder at `/Utilities/macrecovery/` .
10. Copy the path of the "macrecovery" folder in file manager or finder.
11. Fire up command prompt or Terminal and type `cd` and hit spacebar and paste the path of the macrecovery folder.
12.If you cannot run this command, add `python` or `python3` to the beginning of these code.
  - For BigSur  -Run the command: `macrecovery.py -b Mac-42FD25EABCABB274 -m 00000000000000000 download`
  - For Monterey -Run the command: `macrecovery.py -b Mac-E43C1C25D4880AD6 -m 00000000000000000 download`
  - For Ventura -Run the command: `macrecovery.py -b Mac-4B682C642B45593E -m 00000000000000000 download`
  - For Sonoma -Run the command: `macrecovery.py -b Mac-226CB3C6A851A671 -m 00000000000000000 download`

13. This will download some files in the macrecovery folder but we only need "BaseSystem.dmg" and "BaseSystem.chunklist" (takes approx. 600mb to 800mb internet)for Downloading the Macos installer.
14. Create a folder in USB or pendrive or flash drive named `com.apple.recovery.boot`.
15. Paste both of those files in the `com.apple.recovery.boot` folder in your flash drive partiton or sdcard or pendrive.
16. Download the latest EFI created [here](https://github.com/devboloji/Infinix-Hackintosh-Guide-Opencore/releases)
17. Copy the folder named `EFI` and paste it in your USB partiton.

**Note: If you need to edit Config.plist, don't Clover configurator because its opencore. Use OpenCore configurator , use PlistEdit pro, PropperTree, or Xcode.**

**You will get display glitches only while installing the macOS via USB or any flash drive. But you won't get Atleast ONE glitch after installing of macos or using the MacOS as a daily driver.**

`Note: Make sure to apply the correct bios settings before continuing (provided above)`

 18. Restart your laptop and hit `Delete`button continuously until you go to bios settings.
`Note: Make sure to apply the correct bios settings before continuing (provided above)`
19. Select your flash drive as temporary boot option in boot menu.
20. Now in the OpenCore menu select the name of your USB partiton.
21. Great! Now install and set up macOS Big Sur as usual(This process will be required 14gb internet to download full Macos bigsur).
22. the system reboots for once or twice so, when rebooting choose the usb everytime until you see your Macos Partition name in boot menu.
23. After booting into OS, You need to downlaod opencore configurator and mount the system drive, Then paste the efi to the mounted efi from the USB or drive. then reboot and remove usb.

# Post Install
Once you have verifed that your machine boots properly without any issues as described in the "What Works section", proceed to do the following

### [Devboloji](https://github.com/devboloji)-Quote - "think like you have Macbook Air."

<details><summary><strong><ins>0. [Must] Boot os without usb or any drive</ins></strong></summary>
 
After booting into OS! So, You need to downlaod opencore configurator [link](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/opencore-configurator/) -> Open `opencore-configurator`. If it doesn't open, go to `system prefereneces`(Monterey or older) ->  `security`  -> `open anyway`. Open `opencore-configurator` again -> Now mount the `EFI` and paste the `EFI<named-folder>` to the `EFI partition` of your system drive.
 - Remove the USB and reboot. `RESET-NVRAM` once in opencore boot-menu and reboot..Done...

 
</details>

<details><summary><strong><ins>1.Disable the black screen texts on boot up</ins></strong></summary>

( Disabling the Verbose mode)A new hackintosh User uses this. To disable it, In Config.plist, navigate to 'NVRAM' ->  go to Add `7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82` -> `boot-args` -> remove the `-v` argument. Save it and reboot. 
 </details>

<details><summary><strong><ins> 2. Disable ShowPicker</ins></strong></summary>
 
Don't use this if you are using dual boot. In the Config.plist, You can disable the boot picker screen so that you boot straight to th Apple logo by setting under `Misc` -> `Boot` -> `ShowPicker` False (NO)
Note: you can still see the boot picker with ShowPicker set to no/false by spamming Esc before the apple logo is displayed during boot.
</details>

<details><summary><strong><ins>3. Boot faster or Remove Volume has MisHash </ins></strong></summary>
If anyone facing Volume Hash Mismatch, Just type `sudo purge` in terminal so you can use bluetooth without rebooting the device.üòâ
You can Disable IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext & IntelBluetoothInjector.kext to be able to Boot faster those kexts in config.plist for BigSur.
For Monterey, Disable IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext & Bluetool fixup.kext to be able to Boot faster those kexts in config.plist
This is not done by default to bluetooth working.

***For those on macOS Monterey do not enable IntelBluetoothInjector kext because the system will not boot***
</details>  

<details> <summary><strong><ins> 4.Clean Updating your EFI with new EFI release </ins></strong></summary>

To update your EFI with the new Release EFI. The steps:-

1) Download new Release EFI from [here](https://github.com/devboloji/Infinix-Hackintosh-Opencore-Guide/releases) 

2) Take the backup of SMBios or windows dual boot file to other folder, if you required. (if you want to backup SMBIOS,copy `system serial number`, `system UUID`, `MLB`, `ROM`, `System product name`.)

3) Now add those SMBIOS or place Windows EFI files as it should be in old EFI to new EFI, if you backuped before.

4) Mount the EFI partition, Delete the OLD EFI.

5) Copy and paste the new EFI to EFI partition.

6) hit reboot, Remember to do only Reset NVRAM once.

7) Done, you have done a clean EFI Update.

</details>

<details><summary><strong><ins> 5. Add Device Properties for Serial number, MLB, ROM, Sytem-UUID.</ins></strong></summary>
 
Use `MacBookAir9,1` SMBios. Recommended : opencore configurator, Go to the  `PlatformInfo >SMBios`Tick the "Add to the section to config file" in `SMBIOS` and `DATAHUB -GENERIC- PLATFORMNVRAM` and continue your Adding your SMBIOS.
Follow this [Opencore guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) to set up serial number and the accompanying info to get iServices.
 
 Trick to Get exact Processor details in System Information - When you are adding the smbios, Edit `processor type` -> `0` or delete inside of `processor-type` .
 </details>
 
<details><summary><strong><ins> 6.To fix cursor glitch (ignore, if you are done, before installing)</ins></strong></summary>
 
Goto Bios Settings -> `Chipset Section -> System Agent (SA) Configuration -> Graphics Configuration`

Set` DVMT Total Gfx Memory` setting to `Max`
Set `DVMT PPre-Allocated` Setting to `160M` or to `max`
</details>
<details><summary><strong><ins>7.Fix Imessage and Facetime. </ins></strong></summary>
 
If you are new to the apple account or if you are using apple account for the first time in hackintosh, You need to use the apple account for one month and use icloud. Even though, the imessages or factime don't work..
- ‚Å†iMessages and Face TIme works if we connect the internet via USB(usb debugging),
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Music works on Wi-Fi.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†‚Å†Message and face time works on usb(usb debugging) need HornDIS application installed on mac if not detected.
or else you need to remove AirportItlwm.kext and replace with Heliport(itlwm) as complete fix, but you need to sacrifice speed and nativity of wifi.
The thing is "Use it" for a month or more and automatically after some days, Magically facetime and imessages workss...Tada...
 </details>
 
 <details><summary><strong><ins> 8.Fix "interface is small" (small text and window issue)</ins></string></summary>
 
- To fix, use [one key high dpi](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi) here and run `hidpi.command` in the folder and choose `(1) Enable HIDPI` by typing `1` -> Then choose `Macbook` -> if you want 1920x1080p with best quality use `(4) 2560x1440 Display` or if you want more scale use `(2) 1920x1080 Display (use 1424x802, fix underscaled after sleep)`  or Recommended: for custom resolution -> choose `(6) Manual input resolution` -> then type `1472x828` hit enter -> Reboot your device.
 
-  After rebooting, go to `system Preferences` -> `Display` -> choose `Scaled` and select what you like.
  </details>
 
 <details><summary><strong><ins> 10. Install Windows in Pre-installed MacOS (Dual-Boot). </ins></strong></summary>
 
 - This process is very simple for dual boot and can ask doubts and issues here.
 
 1. Take a Usb or sd-card, connect to pc & Launch `Disk Utility` -> Select `View` > `Show all devices` at the top left.
 2. Select your flash device (root of your usb device)and format it as `MS-DOS (FAT)` or `FAT-32`. Change `guid patition table` -> `Master Boot Record Partiton`. Hit start(by doing this the sdcard formats so you will lose the all the data in sdcard).
 3. Copy the EFI that you are using right now to the `USB` device.
 4. Now download the [Microsoft.zip](https://github.com/devboloji/Infinix-Hackintosh-Opencore-Guide/blob/main/Microsoft.zip) file from my Github and paste the `Microsoft<folder>` inside of `EFI` folder of the USB or sdcard(where you see the `boot`,`OC` folders inside of EFI<folder> in your USb).
 5. Next, to partition your drive, -> Launch `Disk Utility` -> Select `View` > `Show all devices` at the top left -> Choose your `MacOS-drive` as root -> Click `Partition` -> click `add partition` if you see a popup -> `Name` your partition. -> Change the `Format` type to `ExFat` or `Ms-dos` -> Adjust your `Partition size` as you like. click `Apply`. This process takes atleast 15 min. 
 6. Take an Another USB, Now Make bootable of required version of windows by rufus or any other.
 7. Boot to USB from bios. Run the windows Installer as Asusual. But remember to install in your windows Partition in `where to install` in windows disk.
 8. When you boot into windows, install all Updates and you can also restart when updates required reboot.(Forget about macOS for now). After installing all updates, Plug in the `EFI usb` or sdcard(that you previously copied the EFI and Microsoft folders) and reboot to usb from bios to boot into MacOS.
 9. When you boot into MacOS, <ins>Mount the EFI folder</ins>, and Replace default EFI(the drive efi) with your usb or sdcard EFI. Unmount the EFI and reboot.
 10. Try checking the boot menus by Rebooting to macOS & Windows.(you can see "MacOS" & "Windows" in boot-menu)..
 11. Now you can Easily get Windows & MacOS on boot-menu. Enjoy.
 
Thanks to [NitinGaury](https://github.com/nitingaury) for sharing the Dual-boot win&macos in EFI.
